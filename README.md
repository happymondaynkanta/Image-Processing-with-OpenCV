Image processing is one of the most common term in computer vision. Computer vision is the process by which computers can understand images and videos, and  how they are stored, manipulated, and retrieve details from them. OpenCV is an open source computer vision  image processing library for machine learning, deep leaning and AI application which plays a major role in real-time operation which is very important in todayâ€™s systems.

This repository contains codes that address the basic concepts of image processing using OpenCV library. The following image processing tasks are;

### reading images
### Saving images
### Capturing video
### Loading videos

### Saving real-time video
### Retrieving properties from images and video
